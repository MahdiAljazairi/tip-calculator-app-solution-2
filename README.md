## My process

### Second Attempt

I have returned to this project and spent some serious amount of effort on responsibility of the page on different -even bizarre- screen sizes.

I knew I had to use Grid, but I was't sure about what to do to get it the way I want. It needed a great deal of fine-tuning to bring this result. It wasn't a long process, though.

One of the most frustrating areas was the hero image section. As spaces above and beneath it can get drastically huge on mobiles. Later did I realize I needed to specify the hero section's height on small screen widths with `vh` units instead of `fr` units, inorder to make it grow and shrink regardless of how much free space there is.

After this, I did for sure learn a lot about grid areas and how to make use of them. And although I have approached it desktop-first rather than mobile-first, I honestly don't think it's a big deal since it works fine.

### Hardest part

Managing all the alerts systematically was the most troublesome part of the process. But this project gave me confidence to work with Javascript.

### What I learned

Programming is so damn HARD! And so is responsive layout.. üòê

Also, the `in` operator tests presence of keys/indexes, not values. Learned the hard way.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was constantly referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VSCode, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
